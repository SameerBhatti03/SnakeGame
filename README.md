Snake Game on ZYBO Z7010 with Pmod OLED and Pmod Keypad


Developed an interactive Snake Game using a ZYBO Z7010 FPGA board, integrating Pmod OLED and Pmod Keypad modules from Digilent. The project demonstrates proficiency in hardware-software co-design, including:

- Hardware Development: Designed the hardware architecture and performed pin assignments using Vivado.
- Software Implementation: Programmed game logic in C using Vitis, including dynamic score tracking, collision detection, and custom speed selection.
- Gameplay Features:
     - Real-time game display on the OLED screen.
     - Keypad-based controls for snake movement and speed adjustment.
     - High score tracking with a dedicated screen interface.
- Technical Highlights:
     - Utilized Pmod peripherals for seamless hardware interfacing.
     - Implemented real-time processing and graphical updates on an embedded system.
     - Applied modular design practices for scalability and performance optimization.
This project showcases expertise in embedded systems, FPGA development, and user-interactive applications.
